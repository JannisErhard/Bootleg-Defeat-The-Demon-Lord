# Defeat-The-Demon-Lord
I made a game based on a programming exercise
## Controls 
Press Up, Left, Right, Down to turn.

Press 'f' to move in the direction you are pointing.

Faces are enemies (in general, not just in the game).

White faces have 2 attack and 1 HP.

Black faces have 3 attack and 10 HP.

Stand in Front of an enemy and press 'a' to attack.

H, K and C are items, acquired by walking onto them.

Use H K and C by pressing 'h', 'k'  or 'c'.

H is potion and restores Health.

K is Key and removes doors if they are in fornt of you. Doors look like "-" or "|".

C is Coin and used to make M go away.

M is another kind of door, it only needs special keys, C, and 3 of them, to open.



## Disclaimer
The code doesn't solve the exercise. It's also written poorly.
